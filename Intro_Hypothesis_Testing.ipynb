    "# Hypothesis Testing - simple examples\n",
    "### Dr. Tirthajyoti Sarkar, Fremont, 94536\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a critical tool in inferential statistics, for determing what the value of a population parameter could be. We often draw this conclusion based on a sample data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check this document for a [quick and comprehensive link](https://github.com/tirthajyoti/Stats-Maths-with-Python/blob/master/Resources/Introduction%20to%20Hypothesis%20Testing.pdf).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis: $H_0$**\n",
    "<br>**Alternative Hypothesis: $H_a$**\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests we will discuss in this notebook are:\n",

    "- One Population Proportion\n",
    "- Difference in Population Proportions\n",
    "- One Population Mean\n",
    "- Difference in Population Means\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will also introduce some functions (from the `statsmodels` Python package) that are extremely useful when calculating a t-statistic, or a z-statistic, and corresponding p-values for a hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly review the following ways to calculate a test statistic for the tests listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation is:\n",
